Both the [MedicationRequest] and [MedicationStatement] resources can be used to record a patient's medication.   For more information about the context for their usages, refer to the medication domain [boundaries section]. This profile sets minimum expectations for the MedicationRequest resource to record, search and fetch medications associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile.

**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core-MedicationRequest
profile:

-   Query for medications that have been prescribed to a particular
    patient
-   Record medications that have been prescribed to a particular
    patient

###### Mandatory Data Elements and Terminology


The following data-elements are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present). These are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [**Formal Profile Definition**](#profile) below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.  

**Each MedicationRequest must have:**

1.  a status
1.  a medication
1.  a patient
1.  a date for when written
1.  a prescriber

Additionally your system [Must Support]:

1. the prescription *Sig*


**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

*  The MedicationStatement and MedicationRequest resources can represent a medication using either a code, or reference a [Medication] resource.
    *  When referencing a Medication resource,  the resource may be [contained] or an external resource.
    *  The server application MAY choose any combination of these methods, but if an external reference to Medication is used, the server SHALL support the [include] parameter for searching this element.
    *  The client application SHALL support all methods.  
    *  Additional guidance is provided below in the Search section and in the [CapabilityStatement] section.

##### Examples

- [MedicationRequest-uscore-mo1](MedicationRequest-uscore-mo1.html) Inline medication code to represent the medication.
- [MedicationRequest-uscore-mo2](MedicationRequest-uscore-mo2.html) Reference to a [contained]({{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html#contained) Medication resource.
