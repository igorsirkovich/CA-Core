  "description": "This operation is used to return all the references to documents related to a patient.  The operation takes the input parameters:  - patient id - start date - end date - document type  and returns a [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) of type \"searchset\" containing [US Core DocumentReference Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core-r4/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html) for the patient. If the server has or can create documents that are related to the patient, and that are available for the given user, the server returns the DocumentReference profiles needed to support the records.  The principle intended use for this operation is to provide a provider or patient with access to their available document information.  The server SHOULD return at least all references for documents that it has made available in a document indexing system. This is the same as a simple query (`GET [base]/DocumentReference?patient=[id]`). This operaton differs from a simple query in that  DocumentReferences may be created 'on-the-fly' in response to this operation.  For example, in some cases the documents themselves may not exist but can be generated when needed so a reference to them can be generated using this operation. If no documents exist and an 'on-demand' document cannot be created then the operation will return an empty search bundle.",
  "code": "docref",
  "comment": " - The server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones). This frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for.  - The document itself can be subsequently retrieved using the link provided from the DocumentQuery search results. The link could,for example, be a FHIR endpoint to a Binary Resource or some other document repository.  It is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error. Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification",
