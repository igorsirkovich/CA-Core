This profile was generated from [HL7 StructureDefinition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/encounter.profile.json) on 2019-03-28 and constrained during a review of US Core against Canadian sources.

Key differences from [USCoreR4 Encounter](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/StructureDefinition-us-core-encounter.html):
- updated references to profiles in this guide
- added back reference ProviderRole (profile from this guide), unsure of implication

**[ToDo]:**

[x] review USCoreR4 profile and draft extensions and restrictions

[] review structure against pan-CDN HL7 v3

[] review structure against existing CAD FHIR specs

[] review [US_Core_Encounter_Type](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/ValueSet-us-core-encounter-type.html) valueSet against CAD equiv and update **Encounter.type** binding (if necessary)

[] add constraints (cross element) from USCoreR4

[] refine constraints (cross element) to CAD requirements ?
