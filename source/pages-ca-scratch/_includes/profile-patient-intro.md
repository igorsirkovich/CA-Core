**Notes:**
- Profile is based on [USCoreR4 Patient](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html)
- Key differences and rationale:
  - US Race and Ethnicity were removed (not a Canadian requirement)
  - Slicing and example for Canadian Jurisdictional Health Number (JHN) with extension for version code
  - Removed US Simple-Language ValueSet (some Canadian specs use full http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47)
- Example JHN and Patient Information from [Ontario Health Care Validation Reference Manual](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/pub/ohip/ohipvalid_manual/ohipvalid_manual.pdf)
