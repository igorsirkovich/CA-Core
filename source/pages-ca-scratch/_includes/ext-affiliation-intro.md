Indentifies an organization that a resource is affiliated with, the type of affiliation and, optionally, the period of the affiliation.

**Note:** this extension is adapted (generalized) from the [ext-location-affiliation](https://simplifier.net/ProvincialProviderRe/location-affiliation/~json) extension used in the ON PPR guide, which is semantically different than managingOrganization.  Requirements are looser, and the "with" element has been replaced with an approach more similar to the Resource datatype.

**Potential Issue:** The approach used to add affiliationType and Period to the extension needs to be validated. **[ToDo]**
